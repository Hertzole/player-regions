# Player Regions
A Minecraft plugin that allows your players to easily and safely claim land for a optional price.

## What?
Player Regions is a Minecraft plugin that easily allows your players to claim land using [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard). It claims every block in a player specified region from 0 to 255 on the Y level. For each block column, it will increase the price you set in a config.

## Development notice
This plugin is being developed for a private server. This means I may never finish this plugin, nor keep it updated. It's just here for reference. But it also means it's never really done. It's in active development.

## License
Do whatever. I don't care. I just ask for your morality to not straight up rip the code and sell it as a premium plugin.. but hey, I'm not gonna stop you.
